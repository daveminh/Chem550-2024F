Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\n","\n","This notebook will not be a comprehensive Python tutorial.

exercise, but for the uninitiated we will offer a quick introduction here.\n","\n",">The shell is a way to interact textually with your computer.\n","Ever since the mid 1980s, when Microsoft and Apple introduced the first versions of their now ubiquitous graphical operating systems, most computer users have interacted with their operating system through familiar clicking of menus and drag-and-drop movements.\n","But operating systems existed long before these graphical user interfaces, and were primarily controlled through sequences of text input: at the prompt, the user would type a command, and the computer would do what the user told it to.\n","Those early prompt systems are the precursors of the shells and terminals that most active data scientists still use today.\n","\n","Someone unfamiliar with the shell might ask why you would bother with this, when many results can be accomplished by simply clicking on icons and menus.\n","A shell user might reply with another question: why hunt icons and click menus when you can accomplish things much more easily by typing?\n","While it might sound like a typical tech preference impasse, when moving beyond basic tasks it quickly becomes clear that the shell offers much more control of advanced tasks, though admittedly the learning curve can intimidate the average computer user.\n","\n","As an example, the following are the most common bash commands and a short description:\n","\n","```bash\n","cd: change directory\n","ls: list\n","mv: move\n","cp: copy\n","mkdir: make new directory\n","history: terminal history (i.e. history of the commands you have executed) help: command list & help\n","echo: outputs to terminal\n","expr: evaluate expression and outputs to terminal\n","wc: word count\n","cat: ‚Äúconcatenate‚Äù streams all input to the terminal\n","sed: ‚Äústream editor‚Äù edits input (most importantly substitute) and outputs to the terminal \n","vim: ‚Äúvisual‚Äù visualizes input and allows for edition\n","grep: ‚ÄúGlobal regular expression print‚Äù, searches a given expression and outputs to terminal \n","awk: pattern scanning & processing language\n","```\n","\n","Notice that all of this is just a compact way to do familiar operations (navigating a directory structure, creating a directory, moving a file, etc.) by typing commands rather than clicking icons and menus.\n","Note that with just a few commands (``pwd``, ``ls``, ``cd``, ``mkdir``, and ``cp``) you can do many of the most common file operations.\n","It's when you go beyond these basics that the shell approach becomes really powerful."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dPnY__n_n98v"},"source":["### Shell Commands in iPython\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gDHNJOIBeC7L"},"source":["\n","Any command
