Materials from this class were adapted from previous versions of the class and online workshops. Some of these sources may be useful to students of this class.

# History

* I taught Chem 550 in Fall of 2013, 2014, and 2015. The theoretical material is very similar to these previous classes.
* I taught Chem 456 in Spring 2020, Summer 2021, and [Fall 2022](https://daveminh.github.io/Chem456-2022F/). Over these classes, I developed the structure that I use in this class.

# Sources

* In Summer 2022, I took [Computational Chemistry for Chemistry Educators](http://www.computationalscience.org/ccce/about/sessions/sessions.php). Exercises in this class are adapted from labs in this program.
